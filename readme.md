# Rare Server
<!-- TODO: Add a description of the Rare application -->
Our client, Rare Publishing, needs a new application built for their readers. Currently, readers can submit new articles through the mail and once month Rare sends out a Zine of articles that the publishers liked the most. They've finally decided that the internet is not a fad and want a new way for readers view posts.

The finished application will give users the ability to submit, update and comment on posts. The posts will also be organized by tags and categories making it easier for the reader to find the posts they are searching for.


## Getting Started:
1. Run `pipenv shell` to start the virtual environment
1. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies
1. Create a `db.sqlite3` file
1. Add a connection to the database file
1. Run the commands in the `loaddata.sql` file to create the tables in the database
<!-- TODO: As more of the project is filled in add the other steps to get this project running -->
